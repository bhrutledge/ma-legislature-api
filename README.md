# ma-committee-map

Proof-of-concept for showing legislative committee membership on a map.

Built with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), using data pulled from the [Massachusetts Legislature Public API](https://malegislature.gov/api/swagger/index.html?url=/api/swagger/v1/swagger.json#/), combined with geographic data from [bhrutledge/ma-legislature](https://github.com/bhrutledge/ma-legislature).

## Developing

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

View the map at <http://localhost:3000>, or <http://localhost:3000/embed/> for an `iframe`-d version.
