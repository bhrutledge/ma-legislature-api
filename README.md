# ma-legislature-api

Examples of working with the [Massachusetts Legislature Public API](https://malegislature.gov/api/swagger/).

Maps are built with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), using data pulled from the API, combined with geographic data from [bhrutledge/ma-legislature](https://github.com/bhrutledge/ma-legislature).

View the Jupyter notebooks that generate the data: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bhrutledge/ma-legislature-api/HEAD?urlpath=lab)

See [Discussions](https://github.com/bhrutledge/ma-legislature-api/discussions/) for issues with the API, asking questions, and sharing ideas.
